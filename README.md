# Space-Y-
A Hypothetical rocket company called Space-Y will compete with Space-X
The CEO of Space-Y Allon Mask has asked its Data Scientists to predict whether the first stage of next Rocket Falcon-9 is going to land and will be recovered by Space-X. So that the Allon Musk can bid against Space-X effectively.

# Project Overview
SpaceY, a hypothetical space exploration company, aims to compete with SpaceX in the space launch industry. Unlike traditional space launches where the first stage booster of rockets falls into the sea, SpaceX has developed a method to land them back safely, significantly reducing the overall mission cost. This project involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling to forecast whether the first stage booster of an incoming space launch will land safely and be reusable, based on several features in the dataset.

## Module 1: Data Collection by API calls and Webscraping and then Data Wrangling
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

## Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis by SQL and simple Plots

## Module 3: Geospatial Visualization by Folium and Dashboard by PLotly Dash

## Module 4: Predictive Classification Modelling
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are used to make 4 corresponding models, Confusion matrix and accuracy score on test set is also found out to compare the results of four Models.
## Module 5: Presenting the findings
Made a presentation
